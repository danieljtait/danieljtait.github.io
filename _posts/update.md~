title: "Update"

Couple of things to discuss here, the first is my solemn vow to take a more active hand in updating and managing this page, in particular summer conference season kicks off soon with [ISBA](https://bayesian.org/isba2018) and I plan to update this with some of my personal highlights. Hopefully one such highlight will be the presentation of some of my work in poster form.

This brings me on conveniently to mentioning my *PydyGP* package which is steadily being released from my laptop into the wild. The documentation is available [here](https://pydygp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and you can checkout the source code on [github](https://github.com/danieljtait/pydygp). In a future post I plan to detail more of what current and future plans for this package.
