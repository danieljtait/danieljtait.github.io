  My name is Daniel Tait and Iâ€™m a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh developing methods for performing statistical inference for a class of dynamic systems the evolution of which are modulated by a set of latent (smooth) Gaussian processes. More generally I am interested in methods which display the flexibility demanded of modern machine learning techniques while at the same time embodying some mechanistic or geometric constraints.

  Aside from statistics and machine learning I have a keen interest in the philosophy of mind and cognition and just as philosophers of the past, (think Leibniz, Descartes etc) were inspired by problems from the natural sciences - and in turn these sciences have had such a profound role in guiding the development of mathematics - I think that the philosophy of mind, neuroscience, psychology and so on will be equally important in inspiring new mathematics to describe these and examine these processes. Are neural networks in their various guises our Newtonian mechanics, or is all of that still to come?

  Aside from the above I love the outdoors, from below sea level to mountain top. Like to keep active and enjoy running and climbing. Enjoy watching and reading science fiction and my favourite animal is the octopus, although the <a href="https://xkcd.com/1211/">peregrine falcon</a> is a close second.
