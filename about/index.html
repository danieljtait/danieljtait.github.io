<div class="blurb">
  I'm Daniel Tait, subjective idealist and PhD student in Statistics at Edinburgh University. My interest is in combining modern flexible ``machine learning'' methods with a controllable degree of geometric or mathematical rigidity to help with the generalisation problem and discover where nature's patterns lie. When not doing research I have a keen interest in the philosophy of mind, science fiction as well as running, climbing and otherwise iteracting with the great outdoors.
