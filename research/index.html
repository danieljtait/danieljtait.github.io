  <h3> Hybrid Modelling of Dynamical Systems </h3>


  <h3> Latent Force Models </h3>
  <p> A nonparametric model of a dynamic system is <b>more</b> than a GP with a temporal argument. One promising idea of embedding dynamic systems of embedding dynamical systems properties was introduced in Lawrence and Alvarez.

    My thesis considered an extension to allow for multiplicative interactions between the latent forces and state variables.
