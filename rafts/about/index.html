    My name is Daniel Tait, and I am currently a postdoc at the University of Warwick working with <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/">Theo Damoulas</a> . Our goal is to construct hybrid models of dynamical systems, combining the flexibility of modern machine learning techniques with sophisticated, domain-specific physical knowledge.
  <p>
  My name is Daniel Tait and Iâ€™m a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh developing methods for performing statistical inference for a class of dynamic systems the evolution of which are modulated by a set of latent (smooth) Gaussian processes. More generally I am interested in methods which display the flexibility demanded of modern machine learning techniques while at the same time embodying some mechanistic or geometric constraints.
</p>
<p>
  Aside from statistics and machine learning I have a keen interest in the philosophy of mind and cognition. Past greats (think Leibniz, Descartes etc) were inspired by problems from the natural sciences - and in turn these sciences have had such a profound role in guiding the development of mathematics - and it is my belief that the philosophy of mind, neuroscience, psychology, economics and so on will be equally important in inspiring new mathematics to describe these and examine these processes. Are (deep) neural networks in their various guises our Newtonian mechanics, or is all of that still to come?
</p>
<p>
  Aside from the above I love the outdoors, from below sea level to mountain top. Like to keep active and enjoy running and climbing. Enjoy watching and reading science fiction and my favourite animal is the octopus, although the <a href="https://xkcd.com/1211/">peregrine falcon</a> is a close second.
