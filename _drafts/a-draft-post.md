title: "Kubo Oscillator"
---

In this post we introduce the *Kubo oscillator* as a representative example of what we shall term *multiplicative* latent Gaussian Process force models. The evenolution of the Kubo Oscillator is decribed by the differential equation

$$
\begin{bmatrix} \dot{x}_1 \\ \dot{x_2} \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix}
$$
