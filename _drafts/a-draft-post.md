title: "Kubo Oscillator"
---

In this post we introduce the *Kubo oscillator* as a representative example of what we shall term *multiplicative* latent Gaussian Process force models. The evolution of the Kubo Oscillator is decribed by the differential equation

$$
\begin{bmatrix} \dot{x}_1 \\ \dot{x_2} \end{bmatrix}
= \left( \mathbf{B} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -\epsilon(t) \\ \epsilon(t) & 0 \end{bmatrix} \right)\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix}, \tag{1}
$$

where $$ \epsilon(t) $$ is a *smooth* Gaussian process, and therefore we may intepret (1) as a conventional ordinary differential equation. So long as the matrix $$\mathbf{B}$$.

## Inferring the model parameters
Given a set of observations $$\mathbf{X}$$ which we believe to have been generated by a model of the form (1) with unknown values of the $$\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}, \epsilon(t) $$ we turn out attention to how inference may proceed.
