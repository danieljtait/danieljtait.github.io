Here are a few of my (somewhat belated) thoughts from the 2018 meeting of the [International Society for Bayesian Analysis](https://bayesian.org/isba2018/)

## Foundations Lectures

Conference began in brilliant sunshine and no doubt gave many attendees a wildly unrealistic impression of a Scottish summer and the day was centered around the four foundation lectures
* Alan Gelfand delivered a talk on a point process data and the effective way to model it - his applications were from ecology but I imagine those methods would transfer very well to seismology. One of the most important points for me was the smoothness in hierachrical modelling - in particular the often with additive independent noise models conditioned
* Judith Rosseau gave a talk which on the face of it I'm not sure I should have found engaging as I did. For that a lot of credit must go to her style, but also how quickly she moved on to very relevant models and the discussion of their asymptotics. It made me curious to learn more about the field and that seems like an important part of a foundation lecture.
* Tony O'hagan engaging talk delivered in a a particular way. Scathing on the subject of objective Bayes (see the slide providing his warning to young Bayesians) and there was little riposte back in the questions that followed after, perhaps that war is one? Or perhaps more likely there was no willingess to engage?
* Ed George, began by saying he wanted to presently an application and he really did, it felt very much a paragon of good statistics done well, the sort of statistics that does not seem to be fashionable right now in industry. Now the work he presented on took two years to model and fit with a further six months of validation, an unreasonable time span for industry I'm sure - a previously trained neural network will spit out answers almost immediately and take much less time to train, but are very fast but are blackbox, possibly poorly generalising, immediate inferences really that valuable> Seems like there is a happier middle to be found.

## Poster Sessions

## What I Learned
Conferences can be exhausting! More seriously

1. Check beforehand what the expected poster dimensions are.
2. Poster sessions are worth doing. Not only do you get the imput of established experts, but you also get the completely fresh perspective that someone who has little experience can bring and this is incredibly useful in deciding how you present your work, for instance I restructed the talk I was planning to give the following week to have a better paced introduction without making unrealistic assumptions on the prior exposure of the audience.
3. You can't go to everything. At a conference like this it probably is wiser to pick and choose what you attend. Although I do wonder if there should have some sort of break in proceedings - an afternoon off.
