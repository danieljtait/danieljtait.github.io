Some of my collect thoughts on the ongoing 2018 meeting of the [International Society for Bayesian Analysis](https://bayesian.org/isba2018/) 

## Day 1

<img src="/assets/sunnyed.jpeg" style="width:600px">

Conference began in brilliant sunshine and no doubt gave many attendees a wildly unrealistic impression of a Scottish summer, unfortunately the session itself began on a more sombre note with a reminder that the lofty spires of academia are not isolated from the wider discussion regarding sexual harassement currently going on across many areas of public life - as always when ever you admire someone creatively or academically it is incredibly disheartening to find out they would treat their colleagues this way and no one is sufficiently brilliant for such behaviour to be excusable. Anyway I won't say too much more about this here, better and more relevant voices have spoken already on this issue, but full credit to ISBA for establishing the [safeISBA](https://bayesian.org/membership/safe-isba/) group to tackle this issue head on.

Moving on with the day the centerpiece was the four foundation lectures. Presented by Alan Gelfand, Judith Rosseau, Tony O'hagan and Edward George. Unsurprisingly there was a *lot* of material there, and I think the lectures themselves may appear online at somepoint in the future so I won't go into too much detail, but here is a brief summary of my thoughts

* Alan Gelfand delivered a talk on a point process data and the effective way to model it - his applications were from ecology but I imagine those methods would transfer very well to seismology. One of the most important points for me was the smoothness in hierachrical modelling - in particular the often with additive independent noise models conditioned
* Judith Rosseau gave a talk which on the face of it I'm not sure I should have found engaging as I did. For that a lot of credit must go to her style, but also how quickly she moved on to very relevant models and the discussion of their asymptotics. It made me curious to learn more about the field and that seems like an important part of a foundation lecture.
* Tony O'hagan engaging talk delivered in a a particular way. Scathing on the subject of objective Bayes (see the slide providing his warning to young Bayesians) and there was little riposte back in the questions that followed after, perhaps that war is one? Or perhaps more likely there was no willingess to engage?
* Ed George, began by saying he wanted to presently an application and he really did, it felt very much a paragon of good statistics done well, the sort of statistics that does not seem to be fashionable right now in industry. Now the work he presented on took two years to model and fit with a further six months of validation, an unreasonable time span for industry I'm sure - a previously trained neural network will spit out answers almost immediately and take much less time to train, but are very fast but are blackbox, possibly poorly generalising, immediate inferences really that valuable> Seems like there is a happier middle to be found.

As well as the foundation lectures there were invited and contributed sessions to attend. I will just mention one talk which was by Shakir Mohammed from Google Deep Mind who described a "Bayesian Agent", I would like to expand on this topic in a future blog post because it is very interesting philosophical topic, his Bayesian agent carried out inference in a Sense-Plan-Act cycle, this discrete, sequential model of cognition is one that I think many philosophers of mind would argue is unrepresentative of how animals and humans actually process information and in particular how they display smooth coping it would be interesting to expand on this I think and to use the [Heideggerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heideggerian_terminology) 'ready to hand' and 'unready to hand' spectrum.

Later on that evening the lovely [Kerrie Mengersen](http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/mengerse/) introduced me to students who had come across with her from Queensland and I went to dinner with them, by that point I was exhausted and went straight to bed after dinner - and I couldn't even plead jet lag but this conference is densly scheduled, and gets even longer over the coming days with the addition of the evening poster sessions.
